<h1>Make a dice / RND (RANDOM)</h1>

<section>
Let's make various dice!
<div id="list1"></div><script>make15("list1", "?RND(3)")</script>
What kind of number appeared?<br>
RND (random) is a dice that there are surfaces as much as the number in parenthese.
</section>

<section>
Type again and press the ENTER key!
<div id="list2"></div><script>make15("list2", "?RND(3)")</script>
Did the displayed number change compared to the beginning?<br>
Oh? But 3 does not come out?<br>
This means that three numbers with 0 included will appear.<br>
If a number in the parenthesis is 3, it is 3 numbers that are 0, 1, 2.
</section>

<section>
<div id="list3"></div><script>make15("list3", "?RND(5)")</script>
You can also change the number in parentheses.
</section>

<section>
Do not want to put out 0?<br>
Want to make the smallest number to 1 in the number that comes out?<br>
In a case like that ...
<div id="red-1"></div><script>make15("red-1", "?RND(3)+1")</script>
This is OK!<br>
By adding 1 to 0 that was the smallest number, the smallest number in the number that comes out becomes 1.<br>
</section>

<section>
<div id="red-2"></div><script>make15("red-2", "?RND(3)+3")</script>
It can also change the smallest number out of the numbers that come out.
</section>

<section>
