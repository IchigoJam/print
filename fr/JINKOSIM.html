<h1>Population simulation</h1>

<section>
The Japanese population is 125.13 million. It decreased by 270,000 in one year.<br>
(Nov, 2016 Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Statistics Bureau, Population Estimate)
<div id="jinko-1"></div>
<script>make15("jinko-1", f2s(function() {/*
10 P=12536
20 D=27
*/}))</script>
Set the population as "P", the reducing number as "D" and let the unit for both be ten thousand.<br>
</section>

<section>
When keep decreasing in the same way every year since 2016, the population at 2100?
<div id="jinko-2"></div>
<script>make15("jinko-2", f2s(function() {/*
30 FOR Y=2016 TO 2100
40  ?Y,P;
50  ?
60  P=P-D
70 NEXT
*/}))</script>
</section>

<section>
Let's make it into a graph ('/' is the symbol of division).
<div id="jinko-3"></div>
<script>make15("jinko-3", f2s(function() {/*
42  FOR I=0 TO P/1000
45  ?"*";:NEXT
*/}))</script>
</section>

<section>
What if the reducing number is increased by 20,000 every year?
<div id="jinko-4"></div>
<script>make15("jinko-4", f2s(function() {/*
55  D=D+2
*/}))</script>
</section>

<section>
<b>Try it!</b><br>
1. Stop with the ESC key and check the population of 2060<br>
2. Let's set the reducing number to 30,000 per every year<br>
3. Let's change the character "*" in the graph to another character<br>
4. Let's change a number at line 42, 1000 to 100<br>
5. Let's increase the population<br>
6. The world population is 7.3 billion people. How if will increase by 100 million every year?
