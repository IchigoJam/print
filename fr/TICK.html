<h1>Make a stopwatch / TICK</h1>

<section>
1,2,3,4,5,6...<br>
60 times while 1 second, keeps counting time, IchigoJam.
<div id="tick-1"></div><script>make15("tick-1", "?TICK()")</script>
"TICK" is that number. Let's make displaying several times.
<div id="tick-2"></div><script>make15("tick-2", "?TICK()")</script>
The number displayed for the second time is larger than the first time.
<div id="tick-3"></div><script>make15("tick-3", "?TICK()/60")</script>
By dividing by 60, change the time since turning on the power, to be in seconds.
</section>

<section>
Use a command "CLT" (clear timer) , to reset a number that is counting.
<div id="tick-4"></div><script>make15("tick-4", "CLT\nOK\n?TICK()/60")</script>
You can know the time since reset.

Stopwatch that measures the time in seconds since initializing "RUN" comand to pressing the ichigojam button.
<div id="tick-5"></div><script>make15("tick-5", f2s(function() {/*
10 CLT
20 IF BTN()=0 GOTO 20
30 ?TICK()/60
*/}))</script>
It has been waiting repeatedly until the button is pressed at line 20.

<b>Try it!</b><br>
1. Let's breath-in deeply, and measure the time how many seconds you can keep gasping for breath.<br>
2. Let's close eyes, and press the button for becoming 5 seconds apart.<br>
3. Let's erase "/ 60" on line 30 and measure own button's repeated push speed.<br>
4. Save with "SAVE0", turn off the power, turn on the power while holding down the button, if it started automatically, let's press repeatedly!<br>
5. Let's remodel it to start by pressing the button, and display by pressing the button second time.<br>
