<h1>1 + 1 = 1, LOGIC PUZZLE - IchigoJam</h1>

<section>
We have 0 and 1 only (in logic world), now let's do calculations. First we start with addition. "|" (vertical bar).
<div id="logic-1"></div><script>make15("logic-1", f2s(function() {/*
?1|0
1
?0|0
0
?1|1
1
*/}))</script>
There is no increase in digit with 1 adding by 1, still remains to be 1, that's the "logical sum".
</section>

<section>
Next is the multiplication, use "&". (Use comma to separate and calculate collectively)
<div id="logic-2"></div><script>make15("logic-2", f2s(function() {/*
?1&1,0&1,1&0,0&0
 1   0   0   0
*/}))</script>
If number multiplied by 1, answer is that same number, and it becomes zero when it is multiplied by 0, that's the "logical multiplication".
</section>

<section>
To perform unusual addition use "^". Even when both numbers are 1, the answer is zero
<div id="logic-3"></div><script>make15("logic-3", f2s(function() {/*
?1^1,0^1,1^0,0^0
 0   1   1   0
?1|1,0|1,1|0,0|0
 1   1   1   0
*/}))</script>
It is only for 1^1, but the rest remain same as "logic sum". That's "XOR" (exclusive OR)
</section>

<section>
Logic calculations can be put collectively up to maximum of 16！
<div id="logic-4"></div><script>make15("logic-4", f2s(function() {/*
?BIN$(`1010|`0011,4)
1011
*/}))</script>
Addition of binary numbers with 4 digits. You can calculate 1|0, 0|0, 1|1, 0|1 all at once！

<b>Try it！</b><br>
1. What is the answer for 3|1？<br>
2. Use hint: ?BIN$(1),BIN$(2),BIN$(3), solve the puzzle 3|1<br>
3. Lets do calculations of ?8323^35 and ?8323^35^35<br>
4. Change to different numbers, let's play with secret numbers using logic<br>
5. Let's do various calculations, let's make logic puzzles<br>
