<h1>What day of the week were you born?</h1>

<section>
Input Year, month, date, and know what day of the week?<br>
Actually, it can be calculated by program.<br>
First, a program to display days of the week.
<div id="whatday0"></div><script>make15("whatday0", `10 LET[0],"SUN","MON","TUE","WED","THU","FRI","SAT"
RUN
?STR$([0])`)</script>
Use "STR$" to display the beginning [0] of the string in the array.
</section>

<section>
Repeat from Sunday to Saturday with 7 days of the week.
<div id="whatday3"></div><script>make15("whatday3", `FOR I=0 TO 22:?STR$([I%7]):NEXT`)</script>
</section>

<section>
Using "INPUT", put the year in the "Y", the month in the "M" and the date in the "D".
<div id="whatday1"></div><script>make15("whatday1", `20 INPUT"Y?",Y
30 INPUT"M?",M
40 INPUT"D?",D
RUN`)</script>
Let's display the fed data of year, month and date.
<div id="whatday4"></div><script>make15("whatday4", `?Y,M,D`)</script>
</section>

<section>
A "formula of Zeller" that calculates the day of the week from the year, month and date.<br>
<div id="whatday2"></div><script>make15("whatday2", `50 IF M<3 M=M+12:Y=Y-1
60 H=(Y+Y/4-Y/100+Y/400+(13*M+8)/5+D)%7
70 ?STR$([H])`)</script>
