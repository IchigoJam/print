<h1>Convey thoughts / BTN</h1>

<section>
Let's tell your thoughts to the computer with the button on the left of IchigoJam.
<div id="btn-1"></div><script>make15("btn-1", "?BTN()")</script>
If you press ENTER key without pressing the button, it will display zero (0).
Press the UP key three times on the lower right of the keyboard, move a blinking square (cursor) , then hold down the button and press ENTER key.<br>
It is succeed if it displayed a "1"!

Repeat using "GOTO" command.
<div id="btn-2"></div><script>make15("btn-2", "10 ?BTN()\n20 GOTO 10\nRUN")</script>
"0" displays in a row, let's try to press or release a button.<br>
To stop, use the ESC(Escape) key.

<section>
The program that LED lights when button is pressed.
<div id="btn-3"></div><script>make15("btn-3", "10 LED BTN()\n20 GOTO 10")</script>
Even F5 key is OK instead of "RUN" command!<br>
The "LED" command lights when it is 1 and disappears when it is 0, so it lights in line with the button press.<br>
Stop with the ESC key.
</section>

<section>
You press the button, it blinks fast!
<div id="btn-4"></div><script>make15("btn-4", "10 LED 1:WAIT 10-BTN()*5\n20 LED 0:WAIT 10-BTN()*5\n30 GOTO 10")</script>
"WAIT" is a command for waiting.<br>
When the button is not pressed, it is "WAIT 10".<br>
If pressed, BTN() will be 1, subtract a number which is multiplied by 5 with "* 5", so it becomes "WAIT 5".<br>
Go back to line 10 with "GOTO", repeat.

<b>Try it!</b><br>
1. Let's make it blink more quickly, if the button is pressed.<br>
2. Let's make it blink slowly, if the button is pressed.<br>
3. Let's remodel to always light, if the button is pressed.<br>
4. Let's remodel so as not to light at all when not pressing the button.<br>
