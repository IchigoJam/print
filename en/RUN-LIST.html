<h1>Memory of program / RUN/LIST</h1>

<section>
Let's to memorize a blinking pattern of LED.
<div id="run-1"></div><script>make15("run-1", "10 LED1:WAIT10")</script>
Starting with a number is a command meaning "to memorize".<br>
The LED does not light yet.<br>
A command to run is "RUN" and ENTER key, the LED will light up.
<div id="run-2"></div><script>make15("run-2", "RUN")</script>
Next starts with 20, and add a memory with the ENTER key.
<div id="run-4"></div><script>make15("run-4", "20 LED0:WAIT10")</script>
Use the "RUN" when it runs a memorized program.<br>
Light again with "RUN"!
</section>

<section>
Call a memory, "LIST".
<div id="run-3"></div><script>make15("run-3", "LIST\n10 LED1:WAIT10\n20 LED0:WAIT10")</script>
Inserting "WAIT" between 10 and 20 lines.
<div id="run-5"></div><script>make15("run-5", "15 WAIT50")</script>
Comfirm with "LIST", execute with "RUN"!
</section>

<section>
Programs with the same number will be overwritten.<br>
(Comfirm with "RUN" and "LIST"!)
<div id="run-6"></div><script>make15("run-6", "15 WAIT110")</script>
</section>

<section>
Type only number and press the ENTER key, it  disappears that line.
<div id="run-7"></div><script>make15("run-7", "15\nLIST")</script>
</section>

<section>
<b>Try it!</b><br>
1. Use a function key F5 key instead of "RUN"<br>
2. Use a F4 key instead of "LIST"<br>
3. Let's make a program that the LED lights 2 times<br>
4. Let's make a program that lighting the LED with cool pattern
