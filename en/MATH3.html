<h1>Rounding off(Mathematics) - IchigoJam</h1>

<section>
Let's round down!<br>
41 is 40. 44 is 40. 45 is also 40. 49 is 40.<br>
It says to round down the ones place.
<div id="step-1"></div>
<script>make15("step-1", f2s(function() {/*
?44/10
4
*/}))</script>
Since it is an integer calculation, if you divide by 10, it will be 4 instead of 4.4.
<div id="step-2"></div>
<script>make15("step-2", f2s(function() {/*
?44/10*10
40
*/}))</script>
Divide by 10, and multiply by 10, completed to round down!

<section>
Let's round it up!<br>
49 is 50. 45 is 50. 44, 41 is also 50. 40 is 40.<br>
It says to round up the ones place.
<div id="step-3"></div>
<script>make15("step-3", f2s(function() {/*
?44/10*10+10
50
*/}))</script>
After rounding down, can it round up by adding 10!?
<div id="step-4"></div>
<script>make15("step-4", f2s(function() {/*
?40/10*10+10
50
*/}))</script>
Oh well, 40 has also turned to 50. Let's judge by the ones place.
<div id="step-5"></div>
<script>make15("step-5", f2s(function() {/*
10 INPUT N
20 LET M,N%10
30 ?M
*/}))</script>
"%" is a symbol for calculating the remainder in the world of IchigoJam BASIC.<br>
If the ones place is 0, it rounds down, and if it is 1 or more it rounds up.
<div id="step-6"></div>
<script>make15("step-6", f2s(function() {/*
40 IF M=0 ?N/10*10
50 IF M>=1 ?N/10*10+10
*/}))</script>

<b>Try it!</b><br>
1. Let's round up the ones place of 72 by the program<br>
2. Let's make a "rounding off" program that rounds down if it is 4 or less in the ones place, rounds up if it is 5 or more<br>
3. Let's confirm that it can round up the ones place even at "?(N+9)/10*10"<br>
4. Let's make the program for rounding off to the ones place<br>
