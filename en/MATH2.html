<h1>Looking for common divisor(Mathematics) - IchigoJam</h1>

<section>
What number is divisible by 182?
<div id="step-1"></div>
<script>make15("step-1", f2s(function() {/*
10 N=182
20 FOR X=2 TO N-1
30 IF N%X=0 ?X
40 NEXT
*/}))</script>
With "FOR" / "NEXT" command, whie incrementing a variable X by 1 from 2, and repeat.<br>
It is OK that "N=182" set as "LET N, 182"!
</section>

<section>
Let's check the "divisor", a number that came out.
<div id="step-2"></div>
<script>make15("step-2", f2s(function() {/*
?182%91
0
?182%26
0
*/}))</script>
It can divide properly!
</section>

<section>
What is the number that can divide 455?
<div id="step-3"></div>
<script>make15("step-3", f2s(function() {/*
10 N=455
*/}))</script>
</section>

<section>
It displays the number that can divide both 182 and 455.
<div id="step-4"></div>
<script>make15("step-4", f2s(function() {/*
10 N=182:M=455
20 FOR X=2 TO N-1
30 IF N%X=0 AND M%X=0 ?X
40 NEXT
*/}))</script>
The displayed numbers 7, 13, and 91 are the "common divisor" of 182 and 455.<br>
The largest number 91 is the "greatest common divisor" of 182 and 455.

<b>Try it!</b><br>
1. Let's display the "common divisor" of 3432 and 2002<br>
2. Let's divide 3432 by "greatest common divisor"<br>
3. Let's multiply the number calculated above 2 with "greatest common divisor"<br>
4. Let's count how many "divisors" of 2002<br>
5. Let's look for the "prime number" that does not have "divisor" in 4 digit number<br>
6. Let's confirm that there is no "common divisor" between "prime number"<br>
